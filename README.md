# Spectrostatics

**Spectrostatics** is an audiovisual experiment in the form of a *glitch-browser*.  
It allows you to upload images and sounds to combine them in an infinite loop:  
the image scrolls endlessly, the sound accompanies it, and together they generate  
a visual–sonic landscape in constant variation.

## ✨ Origin Manifesto

This project was created **without prior programming experience**.  
It emerged from a dialogue between human language and artificial intelligence,  
where AI works as a translator between ideas and code.  

Rather than a technical development, *Spectrostatics* is an act of mediation:  
a bridge between aesthetic intuition and materialization on the web.  
The aim is not software perfection but to open a creative space  
where **image and sound intertwine in an infinite loop**.

## ⚠️ Warning

*Spectrostatics* generates and processes audio in real time.  
Some combinations may become **harsh or repetitive**  
and cause listening fatigue.  

- Use headphones with caution.  
- Adjust the volume before starting.  
- Stop playback if you feel discomfort (ringing, dizziness, tiredness).

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the deployed application on the web (Vercel URL or other host).  
2. Upload an **image** (or drag it into the main area).  
3. Upload an **audio file** or activate the **microphone**.  
4. Press **Start**: the image will begin scrolling in a loop,  
   modulated by the sound.

## 🛠️ Project status (WIP)

*Spectrostatics* is under active development (**Work In Progress**).  
The current version offers the basis of the visual–sound loop,  
but future updates will add:  

- More **visual glitch effects** (distortion, pixelation, color shift).  
- More **sound glitch effects** (real-time processing, delays, saturation).  
- Improvements in **UI and performance** for mobile and tablets.
